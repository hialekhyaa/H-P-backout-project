H&P Backout Project
Goal: Analyze setpoint, depth, and bit/pipe size data from rigs to find similarities between backouts.
Specific Rig Data during backouts not provided for data protection. 

To pull oscillator data: Run OscltData.py and input the filename of the rig. File has the format RXXX.csv.
Setpoints: These can be viewed with SetPointGraphs.py. To add Rigs to this graph. Add data to setpoints.csv. 
For Bit/Pipe Size: Add to the sizes.csv file to see updated stats. The script counts the number of occurremces of each bit or pipe size.
